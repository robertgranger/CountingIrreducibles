Supporting Magma and Maple code for the paper `On the Enumeration of Irreducible Polynomials over GF(q)
with Prescribed Coefficients', by Robert Granger.

These allow the reader to verifiy the computations stated in the paper, and also to experiment further.

Magma code files end with ".m" while Maple worksheets end with ".mw". 

The relevant sections of the paper indicate what each file is for.
