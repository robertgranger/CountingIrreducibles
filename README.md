# CountingIrreducibles
This repository contains supporting Magma and Maple code for the paper entitled "On the Enumeration of Irreducible Polynomials over GF(q)
with Prescribed Coefficients", by Robert Granger.

The code allows the reader to verify the computations stated in the paper, and also to experiment further. The relevant sections of the paper indicate what each file is for.

Magma files end with ".m". Maple files are tarred in order to preserve their formatting.
